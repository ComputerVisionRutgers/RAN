						<h1 class="snop_title">Synopsis</h1>
						<br><br>
						<p class="snop_text">As wireless sensing and networking technologies make significant strides in today’s world, applications such as automated driving or augmented reality are increasingly involving rich sensing of the environment with unprecedented network requirements. Existing approaches that strictly separate the network stack and the perception component face challenges in providing robust perception and high-bandwidth networking. To address this, this project develops and studies a reality-aware wireless architecture that blends networking and sensing components, rather than isolating them. This approach exploits sensor information and scene geometry to provide improved and more predictable wireless network performance. It also uses information received over the network to aid perception functions such as object recognition and point correspondence. The team first explores the design space of network architectures for blending perception and communication by designing low-energy tags and visual signaling strategies. The team then develops Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms that blends conventional strategies with network information to enhance robustness. It also designs geometric matching techniques to enhance object association in images with network information. At the network and link layers, the system will exploit knowledge about physical obstacles and the surrounding geometry obtained from camera views and other sensors to provide more predictable and seamless high-bandwidth coverage. The outcomes from the thrusts are integrated into a Reality-Aware Network (RAN) architecture that exploits information about the environment gathered via sensors. The architecture is implemented and evaluated in indoor and outdoor experiments, culminating in a validation on the Platform for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) COSMOS testbed.</p>
						<br><br>
						<p class="snop_text">This project seeks to improve the robustness of wireless sensing and networking technologies through a reality-aware wireless architecture that blends networking and sensing. Robust perception and high-bandwidth networking benefit innovations across a diverse spectrum of high-impact areas including mixed-reality, robotics, and automated vehicles. Key questions include: how can we improve the robustness of perception systems that seek detailed representations of physical environments? How can we support applications to communicate with entities (humans, robots and other intelligent agents) that have been detected through the perception system? In addition to disseminating results through scholarly publication, the project will engage the wireless and automotive industry to facilitate the technology transfer. The project also includes a set of integrated education and broadening participation activities to engage and retain students from underrepresented groups through internship programs and educational and outreach activities at each participating institution.</p>

						Participation in Rutgers Day. Rutgers Day is an event for the entire New Jersey community and is attended by thousands of participants of all ages and backgrounds, many include high school students and their families. This event increases public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology through interactive Demonstrations. PI Kristin Dana organized a robotics demonstrations for Rutgers Day 2024 and graduate student Faith Johnson presented navigation with the Segway Loomo.

						  <p><strong>PI Gruteser</strong> (Google / Rutgers University, New Brunswick, USA) was on the SIGMOBILE’s Executive Committee. The conference hosts events to broaden participation. In partnership with the N2Women group, the conference hosted a mentoring dinner meeting at MobiCom’19.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						  <p><strong>PI Dana</strong> supervised undergraduate students in capstone design including an all-female group that won the departments third place capstone prize Project S20-56: 2020Vision, Team members: Roshni Shah, Shruthi Sureshkrishnan, and Nithyasree Natarajan. Their project automatically recognized human outdoor activity observed by a Ring video doorbell using deep learning.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						  <p><strong>PI Dana</strong> was a speaker at the NJ AI Summit at Princeton on the Foundations of AI that occured on April 11, 2024. The goal of the session was to educate the broad audience of academics, industry folks, government employees and media about the key ideas behind recent developments in AI.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						  <p><strong>PI Dana</strong> organized a Byrne Seminar for Rutgers Freshman in Spring 2024 Robotics and Humanity (co-taught with SOCRATES faculty). Graduate Student Faith Johnson contributed a full length lecture to this Seminar. Byrne Seminars are small, one-credit courses for first-year students, limited to 20 participants, and taught by renowned faculty from various departments across the university. These seminars provide a hands-on learning experience through original research, field trips, and guest speakers, offering exposure to new ideas and fields of knowledge. They meet for 10 weeks, are graded on a Pass/No Credit basis, and are designed to complement students' regular course loads without adding academic pressure.</p>

						  <p><strong>PI Jain</strong> piloted the Mentorship Program at ACM MobiCom 2019. The goal of the program is to prepare young researchers (students and post-docs) to have the most productive experience at the conference. <strong>Jain</strong> (along with the co-organizer) matched mentees with mentors based on interest and facilitated meetings at the conference. The mentees were also prepared starting a week before the conference by giving them daily challenges. The response to the program was positive. A second version of the program, to be conducted at ACM MobiCom 2020, in a virtual format is currently underway. <strong>Jain</strong> was also one of the organizers of the annual Great Computer Challenge, which
					  is a coding competition for high school students from the Hampton Roads area, at ODU in Spring 2020. This year witnessed more female participants than previous year due to
					  increased efforts in publicity at school level.</p>

						  <p><strong>PI Ashok</strong> has been involving Women undergraduate students in learning activities related to the scope of this project. In particular, <strong>Ashok</strong> has been conducting discussion sessions on VLC, Python programming and Wireless communication concepts, as a part of the training exercises in the bi-weekly meetings with the <a href="https://www.girlswhocodecollegeloopatgeorgiastateuniversity.com/grow-robotics">girlswhocode GROW club (founded by PI Ashok)</a>.</p>
